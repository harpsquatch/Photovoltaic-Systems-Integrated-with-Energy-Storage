# Photovoltaic Systems Integrated with Energy Storage: A Comprehensive Financial Evaluation Model for Sustainable Investments in Italy
Photovoltaic technology is the fastest-growing technology in the world. In order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, there has to be a further increase in the average annual generation growth which will require stronger policies and more efforts from the public and private stakeholders. The stakeholders measure the value of the investment in terms of its profitability. The profitability of a photovoltaic system  depends on the performance of the photovoltaic system and there are several factors which affect the power generation. This report incorporates some of the factors and proposes a mathematical model to evaluate the financial feasibility of a photovoltaic integrated with an energy storage system in Italy. 
## Introduction

This analysis aims to evaluate the potential benefits and profitability of installing a PV system compared to relying solely on grid electricity. The analysis considers factors such as self-consumption, PV technology, energy storage integration, and financial implications. 

## Installation

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies. The analysis may require MATLAB or other specific software depending on the implementation.
3. Open the project files using the appropriate software and execute the analysis script or follow the provided instructions.

## Data and Methodology

The analysis is based on various data inputs and mathematical models. The data used include irradiance values, PV technology characteristics, load profiles, and electricity pricing. The methodology involves calculating the power output of the PV system, comparing it with the load requirements, assessing self-consumption levels, and evaluating financial indicators such as net present value (NPV).

## Results and Conclusion

The results of the analysis demonstrate the financial viability and potential profits of installing a PV system. The findings highlight the importance of self-consumption and surplus energy utilization. The analysis also explores the integration of energy storage systems and their impact on profitability, considering factors such as storage degradation, cycles, and costs. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that installing a PV system can lead to significant cost savings and potential profits compared to relying solely on grid electricity. The profitability is further enhanced by factors such as surplus energy sales to the grid, reduced electricity bills, and potential subsidies. However, the decision to integrate energy storage systems should be carefully evaluated, considering factors such as load requirements, surplus energy availability, and installation costs.
